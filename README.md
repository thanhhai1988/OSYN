# OSYN
This is the code implementation for simualtion data in the paper __"Using Synthetic Data to estimate the True Error is theoretically and practically doable"__ (ACML journal track 2025)

In this experiment, we simualte 2D Gaussian Mixture data and shift the means with different scales to depict the changed generators. 

# Running
Please follow the example in the bash file for running.
